My solution to Frontend Mentor's [contact form challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/contact-form--G-hYlqKJj).

The form uses a regex to validate emails. Keyboard users can use the "tab" key to highlight form fields. The form will error if any required fields are not filled in.

I thought it was weird how the design has the consent checkbox label change on submit. I had it change when the box is checked since I thought that made a bit more sense.
